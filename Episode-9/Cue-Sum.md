### Cues

1. Why is it `className` and not `class` in JSX?
2. What is `SRP`?
3. What is `modularity`? Why is it needed?
4. What are `hooks`? State some examples.
5. `Hooks` vs regular functions?
6. What is a good convention to implement custom hooks?
7. How to simulate `offline` status on the browser?
8. How to check if a user is offline?
9. When and why do we need `lazy()`?
10. What is `suspense`?
11. Why we got this `error`: A component was suspended while responding to `synchronous input`. This will cause the `UI` to be replaced with a `loading indicator`. To `fix this`, `updates that suspend` should be wrapped with `start transition`? How does `suspense fix` this error?
12. `Advantages and Disadvantages` of using this `code splitting pattern`?
13. What is `logical separation`?
